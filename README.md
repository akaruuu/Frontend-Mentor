- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I tend to forget syntaxes a lot of time. Regularly reviewing these docs will just helps me polish my fundamentals. This is honestly all you need.
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - An excellent game-like exercise for flexbox. When i was just starting out, this game really helped me grasp the concepts quickly. This is a really good and intuitive way to learn probably the most helpful css property.
